Memory Panes Shield, Arduino Mega2560 compatible

10JUL2015
	The MemoryPanes example is reporting a Heap Test failure, I am still verify whether it is a hardware fault or bad coding.
	
	The my_analyzer example is a modified version of Andrew Gillham SUMP compatible probe software.  It is just a dirty hack.  I have messed up the timings to maximize the sample rates.  The Memory panes board is able to run the 1mhz samples with 55.5k, the 2mhz and 4mhz are a mess.
